## This is my blog

Currently under development it will be a place where I share my thoughts, experiences on building a project and my take on new technologies that I experiment with 

*Don't expect it to be some fancy place. I am just making this to have a place to type down my thoughts and ideas. It is kind of self project and I would be happy if it provides value to someone*

> P.S. chances are, the first post will probably be about how this blog was built
